    "This notebook presents a series of four applied statistics problems designed to consolidate and demonstrate key concepts covered in the module Applied Statistics in ATU tought by the lecturer Ian McLoughlin. The assessment combines analytical reasoning, simulation-based methods, and formal hypothesis testing to explore how statistical inference behaves under different experimental designs and assumptions. Throughout, Python is used as a computational tool to implement simulations, perform statistical tests, and visualise results, with an emphasis on reproducibility and clear interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems progress from classical foundations of hypothesis testing to more general comparative methods. In *Problem 1*, Fisher’s Lady Tasting Tea experiment is revisited and extended, allowing the role of combinatorics, probability, and Monte Carlo simulation to be examined in the context of null-hypothesis testing. This establishes an intuitive link between theoretical probabilities and simulation-based estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Problem 2* focuses on the normal distribution and sampling variability, using repeated simulation to compare population and sample standard deviation estimators. This problem highlights the impact of bias correction (Bessel’s correction) and illustrates how estimator behaviour changes with sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *Problem 3*, attention shifts to inferential performance, specifically Type II error and statistical power in the context of independent-samples t-tests. By simulating data under increasing mean differences, the relationship between effect size, error rates, and the ability of a test to detect true differences is explored empirically within the Neyman–Pearson framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, *Problem 4* extends hypothesis testing to comparisons involving more than two groups. A one-way ANOVA is used to test a global null hypothesis across three population means, and the results are contrasted with multiple pairwise t-tests. This comparison motivates the preference for ANOVA in multi-group settings, particularly in terms of error control and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the notebook aims to demonstrate not only correct implementation of statistical techniques, but also a clear understanding of the underlying concepts, assumptions, and practical implications of different inferential approaches."

    "This investigation combined analytical combinatorics, theoretical probability, and Monte Carlo simulation to extend and explore Fisher’s classic “Lady Tasting Tea” experiment. By increasing the number of cups from 8 to 12, the probability of achieving a perfect result under random guessing drops from \\(1/70\\) (about 1.4%) to \\(1/495\\) (about 0.2%). This seven-fold decrease makes the extended design far more stringent and provides stronger evidence against the null hypothesis when a perfect outcome is observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrated how the binomial coefficient formally quantifies the number of possible cup arrangements, and how these analytical results align closely with the probabilities estimated from a large-scale NumPy-based Monte Carlo simulation. The agreement between the theoretical and simulated probabilities reinforces the reliability of both approaches.\n",

This highlights how changes in experimental design can strengthen statistical inference, and shows the value of simulation as a tool for validating and deepening understanding of classical statistical results."

    "The two histograms show that both estimators produce smooth, slightly right-skewed distributions. This shape is expected because standard deviation values cannot be negative and are based on squared deviations, which naturally create a right-tailed spread even when the underlying data are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is that the ddof = 0 distribution (population standard deviation) is centred lower than the ddof = 1 distribution (sample standard deviation). This reflects how the population formula systematically underestimates variability when applied to small samples. In contrast, the ddof = 1 estimator uses Bessel’s correction, which adjusts for the information lost when using the sample mean instead of the population mean. As a result, its distribution sits closer to the true value of 1, providing a less biased estimate for sample-based inference."

    "If the sample size were increased, both distributions would become narrower and more concentrated around the true population standard deviation. Larger samples reduce the influence of random fluctuations, producing more stable and less variable estimates. In addition, the difference between the ddof = 0 and ddof = 1 estimators would diminish as sample size grows, because the corrective factor used in the ddof = 1 formula approaches 1 for large n. Consequently, both estimators converge toward the same value and become nearly indistinguishable. This reflects the general principle that estimator accuracy improves with larger samples, and bias becomes negligible as more information about the population is incorporated into each sample."

    "In this exercise, we generated many small samples from the standard normal distribution and used NumPy to compute both the population and sample standard deviation for each one. By plotting them with Matplotlib, we saw that the population SD (ddof=0) tends to be lower because it underestimates variability, while the sample SD (ddof=1) is slightly higher and gives a more accurate estimate.\n",

    "In hypothesis testing, a Type II error occurs when a statistical test fails to reject the null hypothesis even though it is false. This is a concept formalized in the classical framework of Neyman and Pearson. The probability of committing such an error, denoted by the greek letter betta $(β)$, is directly related to the power of a test ($1 − β$), which measures its ability to detect true effects. Understanding how $β$ behaves under different conditions is crucial for assessing the sensitivity and reliability of statistical procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, Type II error is examined in independent samples t-test, which assesses whether the means of two independent populations differ significantly. We consider a simulation-based setting in which one sample is drawn from a standard normal distribution N(0,1), while the second is drawn from N($d$,1), where $d$ represents the true mean difference. Varying $d$ introduces increasing separation between the populations and allows assessment of the test’s ability to detect these differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each value of $d$ ranging from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.1, we repeatedly simulate two samples of size 100, perform an independent samples t-test at the 5% significance level, and record the proportion of times the test fails to reject the null hypothesis. Repeating this process 1,000 times per value of $d$ enables us to estimate how the Type II error rate changes across increasing mean differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining these proportions as a function of $d$, we gain insight into how effect size influences statistical power and the likelihood of failing to detect true differences. The articles on the [Neyman–Pearson lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neyman–Pearson_lemma), [Type I and type II errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors) and [Student's t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) from Wikipedia were consulted to clarify the formal definitions of t-test and Type II error."

    "As the mean difference $d$ increases, the Type II error rate steadily decreases. When $d$ is small, the two distributions overlap considerably, so the t-test has limited ability to distinguish between them and often fails to reject the null hypothesis. As $d$ grows, the separation between the distributions becomes more pronounced relative to their variability, making true differences easier to detect. As a result, the t-test rejects the null hypothesis more consistently, and the probability of a Type II error drops, reflecting an increase in statistical power."

    "This analysis used a simulation-based approach to examine how the Type II error rate behaves in an independent samples t-test as the true difference in means increases. By repeatedly sampling from normal distributions with controlled mean differences and applying a t-test at a fixed significance level, we were able to empirically estimate the probability of failing to reject a false null hypothesis across a range of effect sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show that when the mean difference is small, the overlap between the two distributions is substantial, leading to a high Type II error rate. As the mean difference increases, the separation between the distributions becomes more pronounced, allowing the t-test to detect differences more reliably. Consequently, the Type II error rate decreases and statistical power increases. This demonstrates the strong dependence of hypothesis test performance on effect size and highlights the importance of considering power when designing and interpreting statistical tests.\n",

    "Overall, the simulation reinforces the theoretical relationship between effect size, Type II error, and statistical power within the Neyman–Pearson framework, while providing a practical illustration of these concepts using the independent samples t-test."

    "This problem investigates the comparison of population means across multiple groups using a simulation-based framework. Three independent samples, each of size n=30, are generated from normal distributions with a common standard deviation of 1 but with distinct population means of 0, 0.5, and 1. The controlled structure of the data allows for a clear examination of how different statistical procedures respond to increasing separation between group means under standard model assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis applies a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test the global null hypothesis that all population means are equal. In parallel, independent two-sample t-tests are performed for each pair of groups in order to assess mean differences on a pairwise basis. By presenting both approaches side by side, the analysis sets the stage for exploring how global and pairwise inference address the same underlying question in different ways, and examines how issues such as error control and interpretability emerge when multiple comparisons are involved."

    "Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a classical statistical methodology introduced by Fisher for testing whether two or more population means differ within a single inferential framework. Rather than comparing means pairwise, ANOVA evaluates whether the variability observed between group means is large relative to the variability observed within groups. This comparison is quantified through the $F$ statistic, which follows an $F$ distribution under the null hypothesis that all population means are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $F$ statistic is constructed as the ratio of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Between-group variability*: how far group means are from the overall mean.\n",
    "- *Within-group variability*: how spread out observations are within each group.\n",

    "The function scipy.stats.f_oneway() is used to perform a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test. It takes as input two or more independent sample arrays and tests the null hypothesis that all population means are equal. Internally, the function computes the ANOVA $F$ statistic by comparing between-group variability to within-group variability and returns both the F statistic and the associated p-value.\n",

    "When comparing more than two groups, one-way ANOVA is generally preferred over performing multiple pairwise t-tests because it provides a single global test addressing whether any differences exist among the group means. By evaluating all groups simultaneously, ANOVA avoids the inflation of Type I error that occurs when several t-tests are conducted independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running multiple t-tests increases the probability of committing at least one Type I error (false positive), a phenomenon known as the multiple comparisons problem, which is quantified by the family-wise error rate. This was derived from reviewing the article on [Multiple Comparison Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem) in Wikipedia.\n",
    "Although corrections such as the [Bonferroni adjustment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction) can be applied to control this error, ANOVA addresses the issue at the outset by maintaining the nominal significance level within a single hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation of ANOVA is that it does not identify which specific group means differ. For this reason, pairwise t-tests are typically used as post-hoc analyses following a significant ANOVA result, allowing specific differences to be examined while preserving overall statistical validity."

    "In this problem, three independent samples were generated from normal distributions with equal variance but increasing means, allowing a controlled comparison of statistical methods for assessing differences across multiple groups. The simulated data produced sample means that closely reflected the underlying population structure, providing a suitable basis for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one-way ANOVA yielded a highly significant result, leading to rejection of the null hypothesis that all three population means are equal. This established that a systematic difference exists among the groups. The subsequent pairwise two-sample t-tests confirmed this finding by showing that each pair of groups differs significantly, with the strongest evidence observed between the groups with the most widely separated means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these results illustrate how ANOVA and t-tests address the same question at different levels. ANOVA provides an efficient global assessment of mean differences while controlling Type I error, and pairwise t-tests supply additional detail once overall differences have been detected. This reinforces the standard analytical approach of using ANOVA as an initial test, followed by targeted comparisons when appropriate."

    "This assessment uses a combination of mathematical reasoning, simulation, and hypothesis testing to explore core ideas in applied statistics. Across the four problems, statistical concepts are examined both theoretically and through computational experiments, helping to show how they behave in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Problem 1, Fisher’s Lady Tasting Tea experiment was extended to examine how experimental design affects statistical evidence. Increasing the number of cups greatly reduced the chance of a perfect result occurring by random guessing. Both combinatorial calculations and Monte Carlo simulation produced consistent probability estimates, showing good agreement between theory and simulation and demonstrating how stronger designs lead to more convincing conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 2 investigated sampling variability in the normal distribution by comparing population and sample standard deviation estimators. The results showed that the population standard deviation (ddof = 0) tends to underestimate variability for small samples, while the sample standard deviation (ddof = 1) corrects for this bias. The visualisation highlighted how these differences decrease as sample size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Problem 3, simulation was used to study Type II error in independent-samples t-tests. As the true difference in means increased, the probability of failing to detect a real effect decreased, illustrating how statistical power improves with larger effect sizes and reduced overlap between distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Problem 4 compared one-way ANOVA with multiple pairwise t-tests when analysing three groups. While both approaches identified differences, ANOVA provided a single overall test and avoided the increased risk of Type I error associated with multiple comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the assessment shows how simulation, visualisation, and formal hypothesis testing complement each other and how computational tools can support clearer understanding and sound statistical reasoning."
